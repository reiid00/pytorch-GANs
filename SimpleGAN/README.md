# GAN Implementation

This repository is a follow-along implementation of the GAN (Generative Adversarial Network) paper presented by Goodfellow et al. in 2014. It is based on the tutorial series created by Alladin Persson on his YouTube channel.

The GAN model is a type of generative model that uses two neural networks, a generator and a discriminator, to generate new data that resembles the training data. This implementation follows the architecture and techniques presented in the paper, with some modifications and improvements that will be added to the original work.

## Files

The repository includes the following files:

- **SimpleGAN.py**: Contains the implementation of the GAN model, including the generator and discriminator networks, loss functions, and training loop.
- **SimpleGANImprov.py**: An improved version of the SimpleGAN, with increased network size, batchnorm layers, and architecture changed to CNN.
- **left_SG_right_SGImproved.png**: A comparison of the output images generated by the original SimpleGAN and the improved version, for visual reference.
