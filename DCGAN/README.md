# DCGAN Implementation

This repository is a follow-along implementation of the DCGAN (Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Network) paper presented by Radford et al. in 2015. It is based on the tutorial series created by Alladin Persson on his YouTube channel.

The DCGAN model is a type of generative adversarial network (GAN) that uses convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to generate high-quality images. This implementation follows the architecture and techniques presented in the paper, with some modifications and improvements that will be added to the original work.
